Experience
----------

**Tennessee Department of Education Jan. 2019-Present**

Data Analyst in the Accountability division of the department. We are responsible
for overseeing the performance of Tennessee's schools. We strive to provide valuable
information to all schools and districts in an efficient manner. I also collaborate
with other divisions as needed:

* Transform student assessment data to analyze performance at the state, district, and
school level to ensure equitable education of all backgrounds


* Collaborate with research team to use natural language processing for an open ended
survey question to gain insight into feedback provided by educators across the state

* Coordinate the receipt of approximately 15 datasets from outside vendors and preparing
reports with R Markdown to be released to the press

**Nashville Software School Nashville, TN	August 2018-Present**

9 month, intensive program designed to provide students with programming and analytical skills
need to excel in a data science role:

Nashville Metro Council Project:
* Sought to answer how the availability of affordable housing for those people earning less
than the area median income has changed since 2009

* Used appraisal data from 2009, 2013, and 2017 to calculate a monthly mortgage payment and
determine how many would result in a payment of less than 30% of gross income, which is considered
to constitute affordable housing

* Found that supply of affordable housing in Nashville has significantly diminished since 2009
with roughly a 40% reduction

Effect of NBA Scheduling on Team Performance
* Built an [interactive web app](https://amarsee.shinyapps.io/nba-stats-shiny-dashboard/)
to visualize how certain scheduling factors affect performance of teams
Considered Rest, Time Zone, and whether the game was Home or Away


**E-Technologies Group Cincinnati, OH	June 2017- August 2018**

Mecahnical Engineer. Designed and modeled safety solutions in SolidWorks for a variety of clients to
improve manufacturing processes and bring equipment up to safety standards:

Research and Development Project:

* In-house project with a goal of creating an automated package delivery system, consisting
of a mobile vehicle to be used with a delivery truck

* Conducted testing to determine viable distance measuring systems from ultrasonic, LiDAR, and laser

* Calculated approximate power usage of vehicle and determined the best power source to be
ultracapacitors, rather than the more conventional lithium ion batteries

Bullen Ultrasonics Project:

* Designed parts to increase efficiency of the ultrasonic machining process

* Monitored production rates to meet goal of increasing weekly production from 40 parts per week
to over 200 to meet customer demand

* Modeled and 3D printed parts with complex geometries for prototypes of parts for testing then used
feedback from stakeholders to iterate through more designs

* Collaborated with engineers, machine builders, and machinists throughout the machine design process

**City Year Los Angeles, CA	August 2016-June 2017**

Americorps Member, IT Coordinator, Service Ambassador:

* Implemented City Yearâ€™s Whole School Whole Child service model in a diverse team of 8 Americorps members
to support 9th grade students at Mendez High School in the Boyle Heights community of Los Angeles

* Utilized attendance, behavior, reading, and math data to identify students at risk of dropping out

* Designed and executed common core aligned lesson plans to fill skills gaps in English and Math
for students performing below grade level

* Monitored assessment, behavior, and attendance data throughout the year and compared it to
baseline expected growth to evaluate impact of City Year intervention

* Saw 10 out of 11 students exceed their testing growth goals for the year
