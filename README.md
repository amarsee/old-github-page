## About Me

I began my career as a mechanical engineer. I have both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, but while I was in school I discovered that the main thing I enjoyed was coding. I took the lead on any projects involving programming, usually robotics (specifically arduino). But I found that in industry, mechanical engineers are typically not the ones who do the coding. I worked to make a switch to Data Science and now work as a Data Analyst in the education sector
