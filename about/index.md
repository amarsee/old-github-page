# About Me

Hi, my name is Andrew Marsee! I began my career as a mechanical engineer. I have both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, but while I was in school I discovered that the main thing I enjoyed was coding. I took the lead on any projects involving programming, usually robotics (specifically arduino). But I found that in industry, mechanical engineers are typically not the ones who do the coding. But I wanted to be involved in something more coding centric, specifically in the data science realm.

Over the years I spent a lot of my free time practicing coding and learning about machine learning. And in the fall of 2018, I took a leap by enrolling in a Data Science Bootcamp at Nashville Software School. I now work as a Data Analyst in the education sector.

In my free time, I like to run, attend sporting events in the Nashville area (Go Titans!), and work on some side projects to sharpen my coding and predictive modeling skills.
